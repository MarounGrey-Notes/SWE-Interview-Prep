# Leadership:

### You're the new VP of Amazon Fresh and your vision and strategy is different from founder Jeff Bezos. How would you convince him that your approach is better?

### Can you give me an example of a situation where you demonstrated Customer Obsession, one of Amazon's leadership principles? How did your actions benefit the customer?

### If you were made CEO of Amazon, what's the first initiative or innovation you would drive?

### Amazon expects leaders to have very high standards and attention to detail. Share an example that demonstrates your high bar and conviction around excellence.


# Problem solving:

### Amazon is hosting a dog show for customers. How would you organize the different breeds in the competition?
### An Amazon warehouse needs more parking spots during peak holiday season. How would you find a solution with limited budget and tight deadlines?
### Invent and Simplify is another Amazon leadership principle. Can you provide an example of how you've simplified a complex process or system in a previous role to make it more efficient?

# Culture:

### Amazon customers are very price-conscious. How would you maintain low prices while also innovating new products and features?
### Amazon's culture is driven by its Leadership Principles like "Have Backbone, Disagree and Commit." When have you demonstrated this principle?

# Technical:

### Our software engineers follow the "working backwards" approach. Walk me through how you'd use this concept to design a new Amazon shopping feature.
### Amazon's retail site aims for extreme performance metrics like under 2 seconds page load time. How would you troubleshoot and optimize a page not meeting these benchmarks?
### What factors would you consider when estimating capacity needs for opening a new Amazon Fulfillment Center?
