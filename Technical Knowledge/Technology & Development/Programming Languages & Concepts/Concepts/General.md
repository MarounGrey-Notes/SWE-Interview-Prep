# Whats the difference between Library and Framework?
A library is a collection of reusable functions that I call from my code. I am in control when using a library.

A framework calls my code and imposes structure, flow, and patterns on my application. The framework is in control when using a framework.

Libraries are portable across languages and platforms. Frameworks are more prescriptive and opinionated about application design.

With libraries, I build using reusable lego blocks I can plug together. Frameworks give me half-built architecture defining the skeleton and flow.

So in short - libraries provide reusable functionality in a portable way. Frameworks impose an architecture and inversion of control.

**Libraries** -- jQuery, Lodash, Bootstrap, Axios
**Frameworks** -- Vue.js, Node.js, React, Angular
