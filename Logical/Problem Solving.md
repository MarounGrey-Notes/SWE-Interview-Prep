## How would you design a better ketchup packet that doesn't rip or squirt unexpectedly?
I would make the packet out of a more flexible material that can bend without tearing. The opening would be shaped so it pours smoothly instead of squirting erratically. I'd add a cap that seals shut to prevent leaks but pops open easily. The packaging itself could have a peel-back foil top to keep the packets sanitary and fresh.
