### What are your best qualities? 
I believe some of my strongest qualities are [your top 2-3 strengths and skills - e.g. creativity, communication skills, work ethic]. For example, in my past role at [company or organization], my creative problem solving enabled me to [provide an example accomplishment - e.g. improve processes, come up with innovative solutions]. Additionally, my strong written and verbal communication skills have enabled me to [share another example achievement - e.g. negotiate win-win contracts, influence key stakeholders effectively].

### Can you give me some examples of how your top strengths have helped you achieve success?
My key strengths are [2-3 top strengths like communication, leadership, work ethic]. For example, at [Company], my strong project management enabled us to [success results - meet deadlines, improve process etc]. And my ability to [leadership strength - delegate, influence without authority] really empowered my team to [accomplishments].

### What is one of your greatest weaknesses?
I used to struggle with [weakness - public speaking, technical skills etc]. What helped me develop that muscle was [how you improved - Toastmasters, night classes etc]. Now I feel fully confident in that capability and actually leverage it to [new accomplishments - lead meetings, deliver presentations].

### How have you turned a weakness into a strength in the past?
I believe that actively developing our weaknesses creates well-rounded and empathetic leaders. Focusing too heavily on our natural strengths can cause blindspots that undermine our leadership capabilities over time. I apply this principle to myself - constantly getting feedback and seeking to improve in areas that are capabilities "gaps" today.
