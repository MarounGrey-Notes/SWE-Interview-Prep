Additionally, my excellent communication skills allowed me to [negotiate win-win contracts/influence key stakeholders effectively].

My key strengths include [project management/leadership/work ethic/creative thinking]. For example, at [Company], my strong project management skills helped us [meet deadlines/improve processes]

### What is one of your greatest weaknesses?
I used to struggle with [weakness - public speaking, technical skills etc]. What helped me develop that muscle was [how you improved - books, youtube, Toastmasters, night classes etc]. Now I feel fully confident in that capability and actually leverage it to [new accomplishments - lead meetings, deliver presentations].

### How have you turned a weakness into a strength in the past?
I believe that actively developing our weaknesses creates well-rounded and empathetic [specialists/managers/leaders]. Focusing only on our natural strengths can lead to blindspots. I apply this principle to myself by constantly seeking feedback and working on areas where I may have "gaps" in my capabilities.
