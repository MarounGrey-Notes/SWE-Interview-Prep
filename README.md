# Reverse Interview
## Trap Questions

* **Who sets deadlines? How do you handle a missing deadline?**
If the manager sets the deadline its a red flag. Only developers know how long something will take to implement changes. The correct answer should be that the developers and manager/business comes to an agreement what a reasonable deadline would be where they consider time to market, scope and balance it with everything else going on.
* **What is the best thing working for this company?**
If responds We are big family or we have a free coffee, game rooms, employee hangouts - run away.
* **What are some challenges you have found working here?**
Ask this on the technical interview, since developers tend to be more honest and this is a great opportunity to learn downsides of the company.
* **Who get's called when software breaks at 3am? Why?**
This is a great opportunity to look how the company values the personal time of the employees and how they act when something breaks.
* **Who is the best employee and what makes them the best?**
'Works well under the pressure', 'doesn't know the end of the day', etc - means that the company values quantity over quality.
* **Who I will be reporting to?**
Red flag if interviewer cant give a straight answer or give multiple names.
* **How does the management track performance? What steps are taken to help employees to reach their goals?**
Stack ranking system is a big red flag
* **How do people usually eat their lunches?**
This question will show how the company values a break time.
