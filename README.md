Very important question. Stack ranking is a red flag. If the position is remote - tracking software is 10 red flags. Anything that is not close to "Hands Off" is a potential red flag. I usually follow up their answer with “I find myself thriving in environments where I have a lot of autonomy and flexibility to plan my work day”

### What are some challenges you (or other employees) have found working here?
Ask this on the technical interview, since developers tend to be more honest and this is a great opportunity to learn downsides of the company.

### What is the best thing working for this company?
If responds We are big family or we have a free coffee, game rooms, employee hangouts, etc. - run away. 

### Who is the best employee and what makes them the best? (What types of charasteristics would a successful candidate have?)
'Works well under the pressure', 'doesn't know the end of the day', etc - means that the company values quantity over quality.

If the manager sets the deadline its a red flag. Only developers know how long something will take to implement changes. The correct answer should be that the developers and manager/business comes to an agreement what a reasonable deadline would be where they consider time to market, scope and balance it with everything else going on.

This is a great opportunity to look how the company values the personal time of the employees and how they act when something breaks.

### If there is a bug causing the issues on a web page, how would you troubleshoot?
To troubleshoot a bug causing issues on a web page, I would reproduce the issue, inspect the code using browser developer tools, check the console for errors, use debugging tools, test fixes, and refactor the code if necessary. It requires technical skills, attention to detail, and persistence to identify and fix the issue.

### What is the difference between framework and the library?
A framework and a library are both tools that make the development process more efficient. A library is a collection of pre-written code or modules that developers can use in their projects.Examples of popular libraries include React, jQuery, and Bootstrap. A framework, on the other hand, is a pre-defined architecture that provides a structure for building applications.Examples of popular frameworks include Ruby on Rails, Django, and AngularJS.

### What is the Difference between SOAP and REST?
SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol) is a strict message-based protocol that uses XML and is less flexible, while REST is more flexible and uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to send and receive data in various formats like JSON and XML. REST is generally considered to be easier to use and more scalable than SOAP.

### How can page loading time be reduced?
* Optimize images. Use image formats like JPEG, PNG, or SVG and compress them.
* Minimize code: Minimizing the size of CSS and JavaScript files can reduce the page loading time.
* Use caching: Caching allows a browser to store a copy of a page's files on the user's computer so that the page can load faster the next time it is accessed. 
* Minimize HTTP requests: Each HTTP request that a page makes can add to its loading time. Reduce the number of requests by combining multiple files into one, using CSS sprites, and using lazy loading for images.

CORS is a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It is a mechanism that allows different websites to talk to each other and share information. If you want to access information from one website on another website, you need permission from the website you're trying to access.

### What is the difference between localStorage and sessionStorage objects?

### What is the difference between cookies and local storage?

### What is the difference between `<window.onload>` and `<onDocumentReady>`?
The main difference is that `window.onload` waits for all resources to finish loading (including images and CSS styles), while the `onDocumentRead` only waits for the HTML document to be loaded and parsed. As a result, `onDocumentReady` can execute code faster and is generally preferred for faster page loading times.
