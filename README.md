# Reverse Interview
### Trap Questions

##### Who sets deadlines?
If the manager sets the deadline its a red flag. Only developers know how long something will take to implement changes. The correct answer should be that the developers and manager/business comes to an agreement what a reasonable deadline would be where they consider time to market, scope and balance it with everything else going on.
##### What is the best thing working for this company?
If responds We are big family or we have a free coffee, game rooms, employee hangouts - run away.
##### What is the worst thing working here?
Ask this on the technical interview, since developers tend to be more honest and this is a great opportunity to learn downsides of the company.
##### Who get's called when software breaks at 3am? Why?
This is a great opportunity to look how the company values the personal time of the employees and how they act when something breaks.
##### Who is the best employee and what makes them the best?
'Works well under the pressure', 'doesn't know the end of the day', etc - means that the company values quantity over quality.
##### What is the most important thing in an employee
This is a good question to learn what company values in employees
##### Who I will be reporting to?
Red flag if interviewer cant give a straight answer or give multiple names.
