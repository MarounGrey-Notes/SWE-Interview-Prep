### [DIFFICULT DECISION] Can you describe a time when you had to make a difficult decision related to ecommerce or web operations?
Sure! I once faced a difficult decision as a web developer when a critical API suddenly stopped working, causing important functions of our website to fail. We had to decide whether to wait for the API provider to fix the issue or to develop an alternative solution to keep our website functional. After consulting with the team, we chose to develop an alternative solution by integrating a different API to restore the functionality of our website. While this solution required extra effort and resources, it allowed us to maintain the user experience and avoid financial losses. This experience taught me the importance of being prepared for unexpected challenges and making quick decisions in critical situations.

In one of my previous roles I continuously monitored and analyzed website traffic, search engine rankings, and customer engagement metrics to measure the effectiveness of our SEO efforts. For example, I used Google Search Console to monitor search engine performance and identify areas for improvement. I analyzed search queries and click-through rates to optimize content and improve search engine rankings.

### [ANALYTICS] Can you give an example of how you have used analytics tools to understand site activity, performance, relevance, and customer experience in a previous role?
In a previous role, I used Google Analytics to understand site activity and performance. I set up custom tracking to monitor user behavior, such as which pages they visited, how long they spent on each page, and which buttons they clicked.

# Answers to Technical Questions for Web Developers

### What do you do if you can't work out a coding issue by yourself?
If I cannot solve a coding issue by myself, I typically consult documentation, search online resources, and collaborate with colleagues or online communities to find a solution. I believe that asking for help is an essential part of problem-solving and leads to better outcomes in software development.

### How would you typically go about a creating a web app?
To create a web app, you need to define the requirements, design the user interface, choose a technology stack, develop the app, test and debug it, deploy it, and maintain and update it. It requires technical and creative skills, attention to detail, and a focus on user experience

### If there is a bug causing the issues on a web page, how would you troubleshoot?
To troubleshoot a bug causing issues on a web page, I would reproduce the issue, inspect the code using browser developer tools, check the console for errors, use debugging tools, test fixes, and refactor the code if necessary. It requires technical skills, attention to detail, and persistence to identify and fix the issue.

### What is the difference between framework and the library?
A framework and a library are both tools that make the development process more efficient. A library is a collection of pre-written code or modules that developers can use in their projects.Examples of popular libraries include React, jQuery, and Bootstrap. A framework, on the other hand, is a pre-defined architecture that provides a structure for building applications.Examples of popular frameworks include Ruby on Rails, Django, and AngularJS.

### What is the Difference between SOAP and REST?
SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol) is a strict message-based protocol that uses XML and is less flexible, while REST is more flexible and uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to send and receive data in various formats like JSON and XML. REST is generally considered to be easier to use and more scalable than SOAP.

### How can page loading time be reduced?
* Optimize images. Use image formats like JPEG, PNG, or SVG and compress them.
* Minimize code: Minimizing the size of CSS and JavaScript files can reduce the page loading time.
* Use caching: Caching allows a browser to store a copy of a page's files on the user's computer so that the page can load faster the next time it is accessed. 
* Minimize HTTP requests: Each HTTP request that a page makes can add to its loading time. Reduce the number of requests by combining multiple files into one, using CSS sprites, and using lazy loading for images.

### What is CORS?
CORS is a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It is a mechanism that allows different websites to talk to each other and share information. If you want to access information from one website on another website, you need permission from the website you're trying to access.

### What is the difference between localStorage and sessionStorage objects?
The main difference between `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` is that the data stored in `localStorage` persists even after the browser is closed and reopened, while the data stored in `sessionStorage` is cleared when the browser session ends, i.e., when the user closes the browser window.

### What is the difference between cookies and local storage?
The main difference between cookies and local storage is that cookies are primarily used for storing small amounts of data that need to be sent back to the server with each subsequent request, while local storage is used for storing larger amounts of data that need to be accessed by the client-side JavaScript code.

### What is the difference between `<window.onload>` and `<onDocumentReady>`?
The main difference is that `window.onload` waits for all resources to finish loading (including images and CSS styles), while the `onDocumentRead` only waits for the HTML document to be loaded and parsed. As a result, `onDocumentReady` can execute code faster and is generally preferred for faster page loading times.

### Explain Webpack
Webpack is a tool for bundling and optimizing web code. It organizes modules, handles different file types, and improves performance. It's great for building modern web applications.

### Explain DOM
The DOM (Document Object Model) is like the blueprint of a webpage. It represents the structure and content of a web document, allowing web browsers to understand and manipulate it. Think of it as the browser's way of understanding and interacting with the elements of a webpage, like text, images, and buttons. The DOM is what enables dynamic and interactive web experiences by allowing developers to access, modify, and update the elements of a webpage using JavaScript.

### What is a pair programming?
Pair programming is when two people work together to write computer code. One person is called the "driver," and they write the code on the computer. The other person is called the "navigator," and they help the driver by thinking about the big picture, suggesting ideas, and catching mistakes.<br>
The driver and navigator take turns, so they both have a chance to write code and think about the problem. By working together, they can find and fix errors faster, come up with better solutions, and learn from each other. It's like having a coding buddy to help you out and make the process more fun!

### Explain difference between SVG and Canvas
SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a markup language for creating vector graphics that can be scaled without losing quality. It's great for icons and logos and can be easily manipulated using CSS and JavaScript.
<br>
Canvas is a drawing surface that allows for dynamic rendering using JavaScript. It works with pixels and is ideal for creating animations, games, and visual effects. However, it is not easily scalable and requires more manual coding for interactivity.
<br>
In short, SVG is for scalable vector graphics, while Canvas is for pixel-based dynamic graphics.

### Explain the term 'Scope' in JavaScript

### Explain what AJAX is

### Explain W3C

### What is CDN

### What are CSS selectors?
CSS selectors are patterns used to select specific HTML elements on a web page for styling. There are different types of selectors, including element, class, ID, attribute, and pseudo-selectors. They can be combined and nested together to target elements with more precision.

### What are pseudo-classes?

### Explain API

# Reverse Interview

### What is your management style? || How do you measure performance, what sort of support do you offer for those not performing to your standarts to improve? || How does the management track performance? What steps are taken to help employees to reach their goals?
Very important question. Stack ranking is a red flag. If the position is remote - tracking software is 10 red flags. Anything that is not close to "Hands Off" is a potential red flag. I usually follow up their answer with “I find myself thriving in environments where I have a lot of autonomy and flexibility to plan my work day”

### What are some challenges you (or other employees) have found working here?
Ask this on the technical interview, since developers tend to be more honest and this is a great opportunity to learn downsides of the company.

### What is the best thing working for this company?
If responds We are big family or we have a free coffee, game rooms, employee hangouts, etc. - run away. 

### Who is the best employee and what makes them the best? (What types of charasteristics would a successful candidate have?)
'Works well under the pressure', 'doesn't know the end of the day', etc - means that the company values quantity over quality.

### Who I will be reporting to?
Red flag if interviewer cant give a straight answer or give multiple names.

### Why the position is open? How long was the previous person on this position?
This question can help to uncover red flags such as: high turnover rate, lack of growth opportunities, misaligned expectations, and unprofessional or unethical behavior.

### If I get hired, what do you expect for me to achieve on 30/60/90 days working here?
This question can provide insides into the employer's priorities and potential issues, such as unrealistic expectations or lack of direction. If the employer can't clearly articulate what they expect you to achieve in the first 30/60/90 days, it could indicate that they lack direction or have poor communication skills.

### What is the remote policy?
If the employer has a remote work policy, but it's overly restrictive or requires excessive monitoring, it could indicate a lack of trust in employees or a micromanagement culture.

### What does your onboarding process looks like?
If they expect to do most of the leg work, then avoid the company unless desperate

### Who sets deadlines? How do you handle a missing deadline?
If the manager sets the deadline its a red flag. Only developers know how long something will take to implement changes. The correct answer should be that the developers and manager/business comes to an agreement what a reasonable deadline would be where they consider time to market, scope and balance it with everything else going on.

### Who get's called when software breaks at 3am? Why?
This is a great opportunity to look how the company values the personal time of the employees and how they act when something breaks.

### How do people usually eat their lunches?
This question will show how the company values a break time.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Tech Reverse interview questions

### How big is the team?

### What's your testing methology?
Red flag is when there are no automated tests exist. If there is no testing implemented at all, RUN AWAY.

### Do engineers own / control their production infrastructure? What happens if you discover a bug right after deployment?
A way of asking if developers have access to production.

### How often are your engineers deliver a change into production? How quickly from identifying a bug, can the required change be in the customer's hands?
Sometimes company is working with a contractors agency and they want in-house developer. But the company might not own their code. Better to avoid.

### How much input do developers have on project design?
Is it only on the coding level or are developers involved in the design? If design gets created without developer's input thatd a red flag.

### Who prioritises what's being worked on? And what is the process for this?

### How much time do you allow your engineers to develop their skills outside of deliverables?

### (for medium and big companies on site) Given new machine, can new engineer download, build and run all code in less then 30 mins? If not, what's stopping them?
Sneaky way of checking if there are any signs of chaos within company's IT department,

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Meetings Culture Reverse Questions

### How many hours a week do you expect this role to spend in meetings? What is your meeting culture like?

### What are the day to day responsobilities? || Can you describe the typical work day / work week?

### How does your manager/team feel about time chunking? (Time Chunking is the latest time management phrase for focus time. In other words, setting aside blocks of time to dedicate uninterrupted work time for a task. Usually 2-3 hours blocks.)

### Is there a flexibility during the work day? || How flexible is the schedule if I need to run errands, as long as I'm getting my work done?

### How do you normally propagate status updates to your managers and stakeholders?
