# Answers to Interview Questions for Web Developers

### What do you do if you can't work out a coding issue by yourself?
If I cannot solve a coding issue by myself, I typically consult documentation, search online resources, and collaborate with colleagues or online communities to find a solution. I believe that asking for help is an essential part of problem-solving and leads to better outcomes in software development.

### How would you typically go about a creating a web app? | Can you walk me through your typical workflow for a new project?
To create a web app, you need to define the requirements, design the user interface, choose a technology stack, develop the app, test and debug it, deploy it, and maintain and update it. It requires technical and creative skills, attention to detail, and a focus on user experience

### Can you walk me through your typical workflow for a new project?
For a new project, my workflow involves:

* Gathering requirements from stakeholders.
* Planning and strategizing the project.
* Designing and developing the solution.
* Testing and ensuring quality.
* Deploying and launching the project.
* Providing post-launch support and maintenance.
I emphasize effective communication, meticulous planning, collaborative design and development, rigorous testing, and continuous support to ensure successful project delivery.

### If there is a bug causing the issues on a web page, how would you troubleshoot?
To troubleshoot a bug causing issues on a web page, I would reproduce the issue, inspect the code using browser developer tools, check the console for errors, use debugging tools, test fixes, and refactor the code if necessary. It requires technical skills, attention to detail, and persistence to identify and fix the issue.

### What is a pair programming?
Pair programming is when two people work together to write computer code. One person is called the "driver," and they write the code on the computer. The other person is called the "navigator," and they help the driver by thinking about the big picture, suggesting ideas, and catching mistakes.<br>
The driver and navigator take turns, so they both have a chance to write code and think about the problem. By working together, they can find and fix errors faster, come up with better solutions, and learn from each other. It's like having a coding buddy to help you out and make the process more fun!

## Theory

### What is the difference between framework and the library?
A framework and a library are both tools that make the development process more efficient. A library is a collection of pre-written code or modules that developers can use in their projects.Examples of popular libraries include React, jQuery, and Bootstrap. A framework, on the other hand, is a pre-defined architecture that provides a structure for building applications.Examples of popular frameworks include Ruby on Rails, Django, and AngularJS.

### What is the Difference between SOAP and REST?
SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol) is a strict message-based protocol that uses XML and is less flexible, while REST is more flexible and uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to send and receive data in various formats like JSON and XML. REST is generally considered to be easier to use and more scalable than SOAP.

### How can page loading time be reduced?
* Optimize images. Use image formats like JPEG, PNG, or SVG and compress them.
* Minimize code: Minimizing the size of CSS and JavaScript files can reduce the page loading time.
* Use caching: Caching allows a browser to store a copy of a page's files on the user's computer so that the page can load faster the next time it is accessed. 
* Minimize HTTP requests: Each HTTP request that a page makes can add to its loading time. Reduce the number of requests by combining multiple files into one, using CSS sprites, and using lazy loading for images.

### What is CORS?
CORS is a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It is a mechanism that allows different websites to talk to each other and share information. If you want to access information from one website on another website, you need permission from the website you're trying to access.

### What is the difference between localStorage and sessionStorage objects?
The main difference between `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` is that the data stored in `localStorage` persists even after the browser is closed and reopened, while the data stored in `sessionStorage` is cleared when the browser session ends, i.e., when the user closes the browser window.

### What is the difference between cookies and local storage?
The main difference between cookies and local storage is that cookies are primarily used for storing small amounts of data that need to be sent back to the server with each subsequent request, while local storage is used for storing larger amounts of data that need to be accessed by the client-side JavaScript code.

### What is the difference between `<window.onload>` and `<onDocumentReady>`?
The main difference is that `window.onload` waits for all resources to finish loading (including images and CSS styles), while the `onDocumentRead` only waits for the HTML document to be loaded and parsed. As a result, `onDocumentReady` can execute code faster and is generally preferred for faster page loading times.

### Explain Webpack
Webpack is a tool for bundling and optimizing web code. It organizes modules, handles different file types, and improves performance. It's great for building modern web applications.

### Explain DOM
The DOM (Document Object Model) is like the blueprint of a webpage. It represents the structure and content of a web document, allowing web browsers to understand and manipulate it. Think of it as the browser's way of understanding and interacting with the elements of a webpage, like text, images, and buttons. The DOM is what enables dynamic and interactive web experiences by allowing developers to access, modify, and update the elements of a webpage using JavaScript.

### Explain difference between SVG and Canvas
SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a markup language for creating vector graphics that can be scaled without losing quality. It's great for icons and logos and can be easily manipulated using CSS and JavaScript.
<br>
Canvas is a drawing surface that allows for dynamic rendering using JavaScript. It works with pixels and is ideal for creating animations, games, and visual effects. However, it is not easily scalable and requires more manual coding for interactivity.
<br>
In short, SVG is for scalable vector graphics, while Canvas is for pixel-based dynamic graphics.

### Explain the term 'Scope' in JavaScript
In JavaScript, "scope" refers to the visibility or accessibility of variables and functions in your code. There are three types of scope: global, local, and block. Global variables can be accessed anywhere, local variables are limited to the function they're defined in, and block-scoped variables are restricted to the block they're declared in.

### Explain what AJAX is
AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique for exchanging data with a server without refreshing the entire web page. It enables dynamic updates and improves user experience by allowing asynchronous communication between the browser and server using JavaScript.

### Explain W3C
The W3C, or World Wide Web Consortium, is an international organization that develops open standards for the World Wide Web. It ensures compatibility and interoperability among different web technologies. The W3C's work includes standards like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making the web accessible and consistent across platforms. Its mission is to lead the web to its full potential.

### What is CDN
A CDN is a network of servers that delivers web content faster by bringing it closer to users, improving performance, and enhancing reliability. When a user requests content from a website, the CDN determines the server closest to the user's location and delivers the content from that server.

### What are CSS selectors?
CSS selectors are patterns used to select specific HTML elements on a web page for styling. There are different types of selectors, including element, class, ID, attribute, and pseudo-selectors. They can be combined and nested together to target elements with more precision.

### What are pseudo-classes?
Pseudo-classes in web development are selectors used in CSS to style elements based on their state or position in the document. They are preceded by a colon (":") and allow you to target elements based on criteria like hover, focus, position, or content. Examples include :hover, :active, :first-child, and :nth-child(n). They provide a flexible way to apply specific styles to different elements in different situations.

### Explain API
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. APIs enable applications to request and exchange data, access functionality, and integrate with external services. They provide a standardized way for applications to interact, promoting interoperability and modularity.
