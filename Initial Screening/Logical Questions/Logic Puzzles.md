## A farmer is carrying a fox, a chicken, and corn across a river but his boat only fits himself plus either the fox, chicken, or corn. How does he get everything safely across without anything being eaten?
The farmer should take the chicken across first and come back. Then take the corn over and leave it, taking the chicken back again. Next, he takes the fox across and comes back to get the chicken. Lastly he takes the chicken across and has successfully transported all items safely.

## You have 12 balls that all appear identical, but one weighs slightly more than the others. You have a small see-saw scale to use. What’s the minimum number of times needed to find the different ball?
Divide the 12 balls into three equal groups of four balls each: A, B, and C.

Weigh group A (4 balls) against group B (4 balls) using the see-saw scale:

If the scale is balanced, it means the different ball is in group C.
If the scale tilts to one side, let's say it tilts to the left, it means the different ball is in either group A or B.
Take the group (either A or B) where the scale tilted and divide it into three individual balls and keep one ball aside. Label the three balls as D, E, and F.

Weigh ball D (1 ball) against ball E (1 ball) using the see-saw scale:

If the scale is balanced, it means the different ball is F.
If the scale tilts to one side, let's say it tilts to the left, it means the different ball is either D or E.
Take the ball (either D or E) where the scale tilted and weigh it against the ball you kept aside (the ball not weighed in step 4).

If the scale tilts, you've found the different ball.

If it remains balanced, the different ball is the one you didn't weigh in step 4.
## Four people need to cross a rickety bridge at night. They have one flashlight that only one person can use at a time. Each person crosses the bridge at a different speed - 1 min, 2 mins, 5 mins and 8 mins. Whats the shortest time needed for all 4 to cross?
The two fastest people (1 min and 2 mins) cross the bridge together with the flashlight, taking 2 minutes. The person with a 1-minute crossing time comes back with the flashlight, taking an additional 1 minute.
Total time so far: 2 + 1 = 3 minutes

The two slowest people (5 mins and 8 mins) cross the bridge together with the flashlight, taking 8 minutes. The person with an 2-minute crossing time comes back with the flashlight, taking an additional 2 minutes.
Total time so far: 3 + 8 + 2 = 13 minutes

The two fastest people (1 min and 2 mins) cross the bridge together again with the flashlight, taking 2 minutes.
Total time: 13 + 2 = 15 minutes

All four people have now successfully crossed the bridge in a minimum of 15 minutes.

## You need to measure out exactly 4 liters of water, but you only have a 5 liter jug and a 3 liter jug. How can you measure exactly 4 liters?
1. Fill the 3 liter jug completely with water.
2. Pour the water from the 3 liter jug into the 5 liter jug. This will leave you with 3 liters of water in 3. the 5 liter jug and an empty 3 liter jug.
4. Fill the 3 liter jug again to its full capacity.
5. Carefully pour the water from the 3 liter jug into the 5 liter jug, which already has 3 liters of water in it. This will fill the 5 liter jug completely, leaving you with exactly 1 liter of water in the 3 liter jug.
6. Empty the 5 liter jug.
7. Carefully pour the 1 liter of water from the 3 liter jug into the now-empty 5 liter jug.
8. Fill the 3 liter jug to its full capacity one more time.
9. Pour the water from the 3 liter jug into the 5 liter jug, which already has 1 liter of water in it.
10. You've successfully measured exactly 4 liters of water in the 5 liter jug.

## There are five people in a line to buy movie tickets, but they can't decide what movie they want to watch. How can you rearrange the order so that everyone remains happy?
For example, if their movie preferences are as follows (A, B, C, D, E represents the five people in line, and 1, 2, 3 represent three different movie options):

A: Movie 2 <br>
B: Movie 1 <br>
C: Movie 3 <br>
D: Movie 2 <br>
E: Movie 1 <br>

You can rearrange them like this:

B (Movie 1) <br>
E (Movie 1) <br>
A (Movie 2) <br>
D (Movie 2) <br>
C (Movie 3) <br>

Now, everyone is standing next to someone who shares their movie preference, so they can discuss and decide together which movie to watch. This way, everyone has a chance to watch their preferred movie, and hopefully, they will all remain happy.

## You have two ropes coated in an oil to help them burn. Each rope will take exactly 1 hour to burn all the way through. However, the ropes do not burn at constant rates—there are spots where they burn a little faster and spots where they burn a little slower, but it always takes 1 hour to finish the job. With a lighter to ignite the ropes, how can you measure exactly 45 minutes?
1. Ignite both ends of the first rope and one end of the second rope simultaneously.
2. The first rope will take 30 minutes to burn completely, as it's burning at both ends, and the second rope will take 60 minutes to burn completely, as it's only burning from one end.
3. When the first rope is entirely burnt (30 minutes have passed), ignite the other end of the second rope immediately.
4. Now, the second rope still has 30 minutes of burning time left, while the newly ignited end will take 30 minutes to burn completely.
5. When the second rope's newly ignited end is burnt (15 minutes have passed since igniting it), stop the timer.
6. You have now measured exactly 45 minutes using the two non-uniform burning ropes.
