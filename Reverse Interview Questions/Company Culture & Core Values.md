# What attracted you personally to work here?
  
✅ The collaborative culture and opportunity to work on meaningful projects attracted me here. I met several team members during the interview process and was impressed by their camaraderie and support for each other. 

❌ The free lunches and office perks were big draws for me. The work itself seemed fine. (Values perks over meaningful work)

# What do you enjoy most about working at this company?

✅ I love the people I work with - my teammates are driven, talented, yet down-to-earth. I also appreciate the support from leadership.

❌ It's fairly laid back here. Work gets done but we definitely don't rush. (Low performance expectations)

# What is the best thing working for this company?

✅ The opportunity to take ownership of and drive key projects. There is a culture of innovation and vision that I find motivating.

❌ Happy hours every Friday! Beer on tap all day. Gotta love that. (Rewards drinking over professional growth)

# How would you describe the culture here?

✅ Supportive, transparent, collaborative. People work hard but also have empathy and understanding for life outside work.

❌ Pretty strict hierarchy, old school kind of vibe. The execs dictates most policies. (Rigid hierarchy stifles agility and innovation)

# What are some challenges you (or other employees) have found working here?

✅ Balancing workloads across ongoing and support tasks has been something we consciously work on. We track capacity to assign projects effectively.

❌ Expectations are not clearly set between teams. Support tasks come up randomly leading us to deprioritize project work often. (Lack of planning, coordination and priority setting would be frustrating.)

# What qualities make someone successful on this team?

✅ Intellectual curiosity, drive for excellence, and teamwork. People that can align autonomy with collaboration thrive here.

❌ You succeed here by putting your head down and just grinding through tasks given without asking questions.

# Who is the best employee and what makes them the best?

✅ We don't think in those terms. Our team values collaboration and lifting each other up. All contributions are valued.

❌ Probably our team lead - he will work 24/7 if needed without complaining. Always goes the extra mile. (Promoting overwork as a virtue signals a poor work-life balance culture.)

# What learning and development opportunities are offered to employees?

✅ We get an annual learning budget for taking courses, workshops etc. Based on role aspiration, leadership supports long-term development.

❌ Not much actually. Usually have to learn tech on your own time. Leadership believes learning interferes with delivering features. (Lack of learning opportunities limits professional growth.)

# How long have team members been working here on average?

✅ About 5-7 years on average I would say. We have a good mix of tenured people and newer hires.

❌ There is high attrition at the company. Most engineers last only around 1-2 years before getting burned out and leaving. (High attrition signals poor work culture and retention issues.)

# What are some ways management supports work/life balance?

✅ Leaders encourage us to take time off as needed. There is flexibility in schedules for appointments or commitments.

❌ Work/life balance? We have critical projects ongoing so you're expected to be available nights and weekends. (Lack of boundaries and encroachment on personal time leads to early burnout.)

# Where do you see this company and team in five years?

✅ Growing sustainably as a market leader in our space while maintaining our collaborative culture centered on collective success.

❌ Hopefully we would have been acquired by then! The exec team is pushing hard for a liquidity event. (Leaders focused on short-term exit rather than long-term vision and growth.)

# How do people usually eat their lunches?

✅ People take a real break to go for walks or run errands. Others gather to chat about non-work topics.

❌ We usually eat at our desks while working. Taking a full lunch hour is frowned upon when things are busy. (Not having space for breaks or boundaries between work/personal life is unhealthy.)

# How often is overtime work expected?
✅ Overtime is rare here and fully optional. Leadership values maintaining a sustainable pace and work-life balance.

❌ Our "always on" client-focused culture means 50+ hour work weeks are typical and weekend work is standard during busy periods and releases.

# How do you handle promotions and advancements for top talent?
✅ We have defined grade levels, competencies and pathways mapped for growth in engineering and tech strategy roles. Top performers get visibility through our talent review program.

❌ Our start-up culture means titles and roles are very fluid. Even stellar performers tend to get assigned more work rather than clear promotions. Company first, personal career second.

# How do you handle being understaffed on key projects?
✅ Leadership owns this and makes the hard resourcing decisions to reprioritize or descope existing commitments to fit team bandwidth. Your project scope is protected.

❌ When understaffed, we expect team heroes to step up with extra hours and weekends as needed until the next hire comes on board. Plans stretch to meet commitments by any means.
