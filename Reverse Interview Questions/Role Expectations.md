### What is your management style? || How do you measure performance, what sort of support do you offer for those not performing to your standarts to improve? || How does the management track performance? What steps are taken to help employees to reach their goals?
Very important question. Stack ranking is a red flag. If the position is remote - tracking software is 10 red flags. Anything that is not close to "Hands Off" is a potential red flag. I usually follow up their answer with “I find myself thriving in environments where I have a lot of autonomy and flexibility to plan my work day”

### Who I will be reporting to?
Red flag if interviewer cant give a straight answer or give multiple names.

### Why the position is open? How long was the previous person on this position?
This question can help to uncover red flags such as: high turnover rate, lack of growth opportunities, misaligned expectations, and unprofessional or unethical behavior.

### If I get hired, what do you expect for me to achieve on 30/60/90 days working here?
This question can provide insides into the employer's priorities and potential issues, such as unrealistic expectations or lack of direction. If the employer can't clearly articulate what they expect you to achieve in the first 30/60/90 days, it could indicate that they lack direction or have poor communication skills.

### Who sets deadlines? How do you handle a missing deadline?
If the manager sets the deadline its a red flag. Only developers know how long something will take to implement changes. The correct answer should be that the developers and manager/business comes to an agreement what a reasonable deadline would be where they consider time to market, scope and balance it with everything else going on.

### How do you normally propagate status updates to your managers and stakeholders?
### What does your onboarding process looks like?
### How big is the team?
### How many hours a week do you expect this role to spend in meetings? What is your meeting culture like?
### What are the day to day responsobilities? || Can you describe the typical work day / work week?
### Who prioritises what's being worked on? And what is the process for this?
