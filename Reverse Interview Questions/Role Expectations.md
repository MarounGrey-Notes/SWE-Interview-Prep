# What is your management style?

✅ My style is collaborative. We set clear goals and have regular check-ins on progress. Underperformers get coaching to improve weak areas.

❌ Our philosophy is management by objectives. Employees are expected to set and meet their own goals. If they keep missing targets, we part ways.

# How do you measure performance, what sort of support do you offer for those not performing to your standarts to improve?

✅ Through regular 1:1s focused on growth goals and development plans tailored to each person. Any skill gaps get coaching.

❌ We grade engineers A to D every quarter purely on deliverables met. Underperformers get put on Performance Improvement Plans with pressure to deliver.

# How does the management track performance? What steps are taken to help employees to reach their goals?

✅ Managers act as mentors guiding teams towards their goals. There is no micro-tracking or surveillance involved beyond normal PM software data.

❌ We closely monitor engagement metrics on employee devices, actual coding time, idle time etc. Low performers get warnings to improve their metrics first before further action.

# Who I will be reporting to?

✅ You would report directly to me as the engineering manager. I lead the software development team.

❌ It's still being decided between a few managers. Our organizational structure is rapidly evolving.

# Why the position is open? How long was the previous person on this position?

✅ They were promoted internally after 4 years here. We need someone to continue driving the key initiatives they were leading.

❌ Honestly, none of the last 3 people made it past 8 months before quitting from burnout and unrealistic expectations.

# If I get hired, what do you expect for me to achieve on 30/60/90 days working here?

✅ Get familiar with systems and processes, understand existing patterns, shadow team members, take on initial tickets. Ramp up time is flexible.

❌ Dive right into 3 critical projects from day 1 and deliver significant committed chunks in 30, 60, 90 days, no exceptions. Trial by fire!

# Who sets deadlines? How do you handle a missing deadline?

✅ Developers size and estimate tasks collaboratively and set realistic timelines. If issues come up, we replan collectively.

❌ Product/executive leadership drives deadlines based on client needs. Engineers work overtime to meet dates once promised.

# How do you normally propagate status updates to your managers and stakeholders?

✅ Through team meetings, standups and project management software. Leaders have transparency without micromanaging work.

❌ Must send daily emails updating what is worked on and details on blockers and delays. Leaders want high level of visibility.

# What does your onboarding process looks like?

✅ Minimum 3 months with training programs, certifications, buddy program and ramp goals tailored to individuals.

❌ Here is your laptop, now start contributing by end of first week! Onboarding is ad-hoc and sink or swim.

# How big is the team?

✅ Currently around 8 developers that split nicely into sub-teams of 4 based on functional expertise.

❌ Massive org with hundreds of engineers managed in big anonymous groups by department heads.

# How many hours a week do you expect this role to spend in meetings? What is your meeting culture like?

✅ Around 5 hours weekly in grooming, planning or small group sync ups. We value maker time.

❌ Between different Scrums, governance, strategy and operations meetings, at least 15-20 hours a week.

# What are the day to day responsobilities?

✅ Work on your squad's project priorities - features, bugs, tech debt. Also support rotational duties like alert response, on-call.

❌ Handle escalations from clients, address production issues, attend mandatory office hours. Shift directions on short notice per leadership requests.

# Can you describe the typical work day / work week?

✅ Mornings are focused maker time for heads-down coding work. Afternoons involve small design and coordination meetings. Code reviews and team discussions fill the gaps.

❌ Expect constant context switching between various meetings, cross team projects, ad-hoc support fires. Hard to predict what a given work day actually looks like hour to hour. Priorities flip rapidly.

# Who prioritises what's being worked on? And what is the process for this?

✅ Engineers work closely with Product team to shape requirements in sprint planning process. There is collaboration and mutual understanding of priorities.

❌ The executive leadership sets all priorities fully top-down based on sales, marketing initiatives and customer escalations. Engineers must adapt priorities even mid-sprint with little visibility.
