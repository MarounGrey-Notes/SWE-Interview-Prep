# How does the company manage and evaluate remote employees?

✅ Results focused. As long as remote workers communicate reliably and meet measurable goals, the priority is empowering teams with flexibility. No location or hours tracking.

❌ We install tracking software monitoring activity levels during all working hours. Remote workers must request approval for schedule changes and provide more detailed personal progress reports to managers than on-site people.

# Is there a flexibility during the work day?

✅ The schedule is flexible based on your specific constraints. We empower teams to manage their own time responsibly while ensuring availability for meetings and making progress on commitments.

❌ You must be present and working during strict core business hours every day outside of lunch. Flexibility for things like appointments is discouraged.

# How flexible is the schedule if I need to run errands, as long as I'm getting my work done?

✅ Do what works for your life. As long as you communicate needs with your team and get your deliverables met, handle personal tasks whenever.

❌ Unless it's an emergency, schedule personal errands and tasks outside of work hours only. We expect your commitment to be here fully during the work day meeting expectations.
