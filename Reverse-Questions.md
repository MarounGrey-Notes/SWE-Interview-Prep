# Reverse Interview
**Top 4 reverse questions:**
* What attracted you personally to work here?*
* Can you describe the typical work day / work week?
* If I get hired, what do you expect for me to achieve on 30/60/90 days working here?
* How does the management track performance? What steps are taken to help employees to reach their goals?

### What is your management style? || How do you measure performance, what sort of support do you offer for those not performing to your standarts to improve? || How does the management track performance? What steps are taken to help employees to reach their goals?
Very important question. Stack ranking is a red flag. If the position is remote - tracking software is 10 red flags. Anything that is not close to "Hands Off" is a potential red flag. I usually follow up their answer with “I find myself thriving in environments where I have a lot of autonomy and flexibility to plan my work day”

### What are some challenges you (or other employees) have found working here?
Ask this on the technical interview, since developers tend to be more honest and this is a great opportunity to learn downsides of the company.

### What is the best thing working for this company?
If responds We are big family or we have a free coffee, game rooms, employee hangouts, etc. - run away. 

### Who is the best employee and what makes them the best? (What types of charasteristics would a successful candidate have?)
'Works well under the pressure', 'doesn't know the end of the day', etc - means that the company values quantity over quality.

### Who I will be reporting to?
Red flag if interviewer cant give a straight answer or give multiple names.

### Why the position is open? How long was the previous person on this position?
This question can help to uncover red flags such as: high turnover rate, lack of growth opportunities, misaligned expectations, and unprofessional or unethical behavior.

### If I get hired, what do you expect for me to achieve on 30/60/90 days working here?
This question can provide insides into the employer's priorities and potential issues, such as unrealistic expectations or lack of direction. If the employer can't clearly articulate what they expect you to achieve in the first 30/60/90 days, it could indicate that they lack direction or have poor communication skills.

### What is the remote policy?
If the employer has a remote work policy, but it's overly restrictive or requires excessive monitoring, it could indicate a lack of trust in employees or a micromanagement culture.

### What does your onboarding process looks like?
If they expect to do most of the leg work, then avoid the company unless desperate

### Who sets deadlines? How do you handle a missing deadline?
If the manager sets the deadline its a red flag. Only developers know how long something will take to implement changes. The correct answer should be that the developers and manager/business comes to an agreement what a reasonable deadline would be where they consider time to market, scope and balance it with everything else going on.

### Who get's called when software breaks at 3am? Why?
This is a great opportunity to look how the company values the personal time of the employees and how they act when something breaks.

### How do people usually eat their lunches?
This question will show how the company values a break time.

# Tech Reverse interview questions

### How big is the team?

### What's your testing methology?
Red flag is when there are no automated tests exist. If there is no testing implemented at all, RUN AWAY.

### Do engineers own / control their production infrastructure? What happens if you discover a bug right after deployment?
A way of asking if developers have access to production.

### How often are your engineers deliver a change into production? How quickly from identifying a bug, can the required change be in the customer's hands?
Sometimes company is working with a contractors agency and they want in-house developer. But the company might not own their code. Better to avoid.

### How much input do developers have on project design?
Is it only on the coding level or are developers involved in the design? If design gets created without developer's input thatd a red flag.

### Who prioritises what's being worked on? And what is the process for this?

### How much time do you allow your engineers to develop their skills outside of deliverables?

### (for medium and big companies on site) Given new machine, can new engineer download, build and run all code in less then 30 mins? If not, what's stopping them?
Sneaky way of checking if there are any signs of chaos within company's IT department,
