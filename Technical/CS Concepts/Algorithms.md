## Explain what an algorithm is and why algorithms are important in software engineering.
##### Simple Answer
An algorithm is a step-by-step process to solve problems. Algorithms help write efficient code that runs fast with large amounts of data.
##### Book Answer
An algorithm is a well-defined, step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or optimizing a process. Algorithms are important because they allow us to write efficient code that runs fast even with large amounts of data. Being able to design, analyze and implement algorithms is a key skill for software engineers.

## Describe the time and space complexity analysis of algorithms. Explain Big O notation.
##### Simple Answer
Time complexity measures how fast an algorithm runs as input size grows. Space complexity measures memory usage. Big O notation describes complexity - O(n) means linear growth in time. This helps compare algorithms.
##### Book Answer
The time complexity of an algorithm expresses how the runtime scales with input size n. Space complexity measures how much additional memory is allocated. Big O notation formally describes the upper bound complexity e.g. O(n) for linear time algorithms. Analyzing time and space complexity allows comparing algorithms and picking optimal approaches.

## Explain divide and conquer algorithms and give some examples.
##### Simple Answer
Divide and conquer algorithms break the problem into smaller sub-problems, solve sub-problems, then combine the solutions. This decreases runtime through smaller problems and parallelization. Examples are quick sort and merge sort.
##### Book Answer
Divide and conquer algorithms work by recursively dividing the input data into smaller subsets, solving the sub-problems on those subsets, then combining the results back together. This decreases runtime by solving smaller problems and harnessing parallelization. Examples include quick sort, merge sort and binary search algorithms.
