## Explain what an algorithm is and why algorithms are important in software engineering.
##### Simple Answer
An algorithm is a step-by-step process to solve problems. Algorithms help write efficient code that runs fast with large amounts of data.
##### Book Answer
An algorithm is a well-defined, step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or optimizing a process. Algorithms are important because they allow us to write efficient code that runs fast even with large amounts of data. Being able to design, analyze and implement algorithms is a key skill for software engineers.

## Explain divide and conquer algorithms and give some examples.
##### Simple Answer
Divide and conquer algorithms break the problem into smaller sub-problems, solve sub-problems, then combine the solutions. This decreases runtime through smaller problems and parallelization. Examples are quick sort and merge sort.
##### Book Answer
Divide and conquer algorithms work by recursively dividing the input data into smaller subsets, solving the sub-problems on those subsets, then combining the results back together. This decreases runtime by solving smaller problems and harnessing parallelization. Examples include quick sort, merge sort and binary search algorithms.
