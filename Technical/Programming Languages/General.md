### What do you do if you can't work out a coding issue by yourself?
If I cannot solve a coding issue by myself, I typically consult documentation, search online resources, and collaborate with colleagues or online communities to find a solution. I believe that asking for help is an essential part of problem-solving and leads to better outcomes in software development.

### Can you walk me through your typical workflow for a new project?
For a new project, my workflow involves:

* Gathering requirements from stakeholders.
* Planning and strategizing the project.
* Designing and developing the solution.
* Testing and ensuring quality.
* Deploying and launching the project.
* Providing post-launch support and maintenance.

I emphasize effective communication, meticulous planning, collaborative design and development, rigorous testing, and continuous support to ensure successful project delivery.

### What is a pair programming?
Pair programming is when two people work together to write computer code. One person is called the "driver," and they write the code on the computer. The other person is called the "navigator," and they help the driver by thinking about the big picture, suggesting ideas, and catching mistakes.<br>
The driver and navigator take turns, so they both have a chance to write code and think about the problem. By working together, they can find and fix errors faster, come up with better solutions, and learn from each other. It's like having a coding buddy to help you out and make the process more fun!

### If you could master one technology this year, what would it be?
If I could master one technology this year, I would choose artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML). The field of AI/ML is rapidly evolving and has tremendous potential to transform various industries. By gaining expertise in AI/ML, I would be equipped to develop innovative solutions, make data-driven decisions, and contribute to advancements in areas like natural language processing, computer vision, and predictive analytics.

### How would you describe “great” code?
Great code is readable, modular, simple, efficient, reliable, maintainable, scalable, flexible, secure, and consistent.
