### What’s a technical challenge you experienced recently, and how did you rise to the challenge? 
Recently, I encountered a technical challenge related to performance optimization. The website was experiencing slow page load times, resulting in a poor user experience and potential loss of sales. I began by analyzing the store's performance using tools like Google PageSpeed Insights to identify areas that required improvement. One issue I noticed was that the store had numerous unoptimized images, leading to large file sizes and increased loading times. To address this, I implemented image optimization techniques such as compressing images without sacrificing quality, leveraging responsive image techniques to serve appropriately sized images based on the device, and implementing lazy loading to defer the loading of images until they are actually needed. I was able to significantly improve website's loading times and provide a better user experience for visitors, ultimately boosting conversions and sales.
