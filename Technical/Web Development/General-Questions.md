# Answers to Interview Questions for Web Developers

### What do you do if you can't work out a coding issue by yourself?
If I cannot solve a coding issue by myself, I typically consult documentation, search online resources, and collaborate with colleagues or online communities to find a solution. I believe that asking for help is an essential part of problem-solving and leads to better outcomes in software development.

### How would you typically go about a creating a web app? | Can you walk me through your typical workflow for a new project?
To create a web app, you need to define the requirements, design the user interface, choose a technology stack, develop the app, test and debug it, deploy it, and maintain and update it. It requires technical and creative skills, attention to detail, and a focus on user experience

### Can you walk me through your typical workflow for a new project?
For a new project, my workflow involves:

* Gathering requirements from stakeholders.
* Planning and strategizing the project.
* Designing and developing the solution.
* Testing and ensuring quality.
* Deploying and launching the project.
* Providing post-launch support and maintenance.

I emphasize effective communication, meticulous planning, collaborative design and development, rigorous testing, and continuous support to ensure successful project delivery.

### If there is a bug causing the issues on a web page, how would you troubleshoot?
To troubleshoot a bug causing issues on a web page, I would reproduce the issue, inspect the code using browser developer tools, check the console for errors, use debugging tools, test fixes, and refactor the code if necessary. It requires technical skills, attention to detail, and persistence to identify and fix the issue.

### What is a pair programming?
Pair programming is when two people work together to write computer code. One person is called the "driver," and they write the code on the computer. The other person is called the "navigator," and they help the driver by thinking about the big picture, suggesting ideas, and catching mistakes.<br>
The driver and navigator take turns, so they both have a chance to write code and think about the problem. By working together, they can find and fix errors faster, come up with better solutions, and learn from each other. It's like having a coding buddy to help you out and make the process more fun!

### What’s a technical challenge you experienced recently, and how did you rise to the challenge? 
Recently, I encountered a technical challenge related to performance optimization. The website was experiencing slow page load times, resulting in a poor user experience and potential loss of sales. I began by analyzing the store's performance using tools like Google PageSpeed Insights to identify areas that required improvement. One issue I noticed was that the store had numerous unoptimized images, leading to large file sizes and increased loading times. To address this, I implemented image optimization techniques such as compressing images without sacrificing quality, leveraging responsive image techniques to serve appropriately sized images based on the device, and implementing lazy loading to defer the loading of images until they are actually needed. I was able to significantly improve website's loading times and provide a better user experience for visitors, ultimately boosting conversions and sales.

### If you could master one technology this year, what would it be?
If I could master one technology this year, I would choose artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML). The field of AI/ML is rapidly evolving and has tremendous potential to transform various industries. By gaining expertise in AI/ML, I would be equipped to develop innovative solutions, make data-driven decisions, and contribute to advancements in areas like natural language processing, computer vision, and predictive analytics.

### How would you describe “great” code?
Great code is readable, modular, simple, efficient, reliable, maintainable, scalable, flexible, secure, and consistent.
