### Can you describe how you have worked with Legal and Technology teams to ensure privacy, security, and compliance across ecommerce platforms in previous roles?
* I worked on implementing SSL encryption on our ecommerce platforms to ensure secure communication between our servers and users' web browsers.
* I worked with the Legal team to ensure that our ecommerce platforms were compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements. This involved ensuring that users' personal data was collected, processed, and stored in accordance with GDPR guidelines, as well as providing users with clear information about how their data was being used.
* I was conducting regular security audits of our ecommerce platforms to identify any vulnerabilities or potential security risks. This involved reviewing code, system configurations, and access controls, as well as testing for common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
* I worked with the Legal team to develop clear and comprehensive privacy policies and terms of service, that were in compliance with relevant laws and regulations for our ecommerce platforms. 
* I worked with Legal and Technology teams to ensure that our ecommerce platform was compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). This involved conducting a thorough review of our website to identify any potential barriers for users with disabilities and implementing solutions to address those issues. For example, we added alt text to all images on our site to ensure that visually impaired users could access the same information as other users. We also made sure that our site was compatible with screen readers and other assistive technologies commonly used by individuals with disabilities.
