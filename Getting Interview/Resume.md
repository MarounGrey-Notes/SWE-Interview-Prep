### Format
- The resume should be only one page, unless applying for a senior position that warrants more experience. Recruiters often do not read resumes thoroughly.
- Use an ATS-friendly resume template with a single column format that is easy for automated systems to scan. Avoid fancy designs with multiple columns or graphics that may confuse ATS systems. Including a photo is OK if it's a common practice in your region (such as Europe).

### Content
-When describing my previous experience, rephrase it using the exact key words used in the job offer. A lot of companies use software to filter resumes, so if they don’t find certain keywords, you are automatically rejected.
- Create a cover letter “template” and leave some paragraphs to modify depending on each company

- Include keywords and terminology from each individual job posting in your resume to get past automated screens. Avoid flooding with excessive buzzwords just hoping to beat the ATS system - recruiters reviewing the resume will not respond well.
- Don't try to hide buzzwords by reducing the font size and making them white/invisible - many companies parse and show the raw text of resumes to recruiters. They will see these "stuffed" buzzwords anyway. It's better to focus on skills actually listed in the job description.
- Have a summary statement with your name and the name of the company you are applying to show customized effort.
- Detail the impact and results of your work responsibilities - not just a generic list of duties. Quantify and qualify accomplishments.
- Make the content easy for a recruiter to glance through quickly with good organizational structure: summary, experience, education, skills, etc.

### Contact Info
- Use a separate professional email address for job applications rather than your personal email to avoid spam. Services are available to create an email just for a job search.
- Include a phone number that recruiters can reliably use to reach you about opportunities. Be cautious about sharing too much personal contact info. Consider Google Voice or a temporary "burner" SIM card.
- Carefully review any online profiles like LinkedIn, GitHub, websites, etc. to assure all content represents you professionally for employer review.

### Online Presence:

- For GitHub, make a compelling profile summary by adding a README file. Use a README profile builder like: https://profile-readme-generator.com/
- Tool for pixel Art in GitHub calendar history: https://github.com/gelstudios/gitfiti
- Better readme for Github pixel Art tool: https://github.com/ZachSaucier/github-calendar-customizer
- Use Reddit for resume feedback (r/resumes) or to get professional references (r/BeMyReference). People often exchange LinkedIn endorsements there too.
- Host your resume online here (for free tier 1 file limit): https://tiiny.host/

### LinkedIn Profile:
- In LinkedIn, make a Featured section to showcase your GitHub, portfolio, resume. If you know basic Photoshop you can use free mockups or AI create compelling images for each Featured Item: https://www.freepik.com/free-photos-vectors/resume-mockup
- Fill your LinkedIn with relevant keywords for jobs you are targeting. Make it searchable. Cool tip is to add a list of Favorite Tools by year under each job experience.
- Add skills to experience and certificates. Take LinkedIn skill tests. Skill test answers: https://github.com/connectaditya/linkedin-skill-assessment-solutions (Use CTRL+F to quickly find questions).
- Post updates on achievements or news using AI to generate content with relevant keywords so more people discover your profile.

# Additional Tips
### Focus on improving your resume 
Focus on improving your resume until you start getting your first interviews (usually with HR, recruiter or hiring managers), only after that shift your attention towards preparing and improving your interview skills.
### Track your Achievements
Once you begin a new job, create a private document to log all of your major work accomplishments and contributions as they happen. Recording achievements throughout your tenure serves two important purposes:

- It provides convenient and detailed material when crafting your resume for future job searches. You'll have a comprehensive list of achievements to refresh your memory rather than trying to recall them under pressure years later.
- It enables you to readily showcase important initiatives you have led or participated in when meeting with your manager to discuss promotion opportunities. Rather than scrambling to gather your "best hits" for self-advocacy conversations, you'll have a master list ready to impress.

The key is maintaining this document privately over time (like in a personal cloud account not affiliated with your employer). As you progress in your role, continue adding to it so you always have compelling evidence of your value. This investment makes resume-writing and promotion discussions much less stressful when those key moments arise.
