1 ChatGPT - Turned into a job interview trainer

You start by training ChatGPT on your resume. You can use this prompt:

As ChatGPT, you’ll be participating in an interview simulation for the position of Product Manager at ____. I’ll provide you with your Resume in an upcoming message. Following that, you’ll receive the interview questions along with guidelines on how to respond.

Then you copy&Paste your CV on ChatGPT. And you give it this new prompt:

The focus of this interview will be on your soft skills. When answering questions be clear and concise, using everyday language. Create convincing responses that an interviewer would appreciate even if they are fictional. However, ensure that your answers align with the experiences mentioned in your resume.

Then ask ChatGPT the interview questions you may get and it will be generating perfect responses to any question.

Use it to improve your resume. You can do several things with it. Start your resume from scratch or modify one, create your cover letter with AI (it uses ChatGPT on the backend), or ask for feedback on your resume. I still needed to do a lot of manual changes in the version it creates but it is a great start. For cover letters, which can be quite a hassle to customize for each job application, it was a real-time-saver. Another option is Rezi, I haven’t tried it yet but it looks promising.

3 Wave.ai

It provided a written conversation with a real human coach, utilizing AI to offer guidance and assistance. The coaching sessions helped me develop habits for finding the right jobs and mentally preparing for interviews. I used it a lot in stage 2. I would go to Wave with the answers I replied on every interview and they would help me improve them with feedback. Ultimately, they also helped me negotiate the offers. I’m so bad at facing conflict and asking for a higher salary, that my first instinct when I was offered the first job was to say OMG OF COURSE. I was able to raise the salary a bit and also the stock options they gave to me.

4 Otter.ai

You can use it during your online meetings to take notes. During job interviews, it is not only important the content of your answer, but also how your answer is structured. And the only way to improve this is by practicing. With this tool, I could review the questions asked and my responses, allowing me to refine and better structure my answers. Write down your answers and then use ChatGPT to improve them and structure them in a way that is easier to understand!

5 Interview Warmup (from Google)

Similar use to the first one with ChatGPT but in this case they ask you the questions. It simulates a real interview and gives you personalized feedback based on your responses. It can help you identify areas where you need to improve. Also, by practicing with these tools, I felt more confident and prepared for those higher-stakes real interviews.
